# EE180DA
Task5_ee180da.py uses the user's webcam to take an picture. It then converts the image to grayscale and resizes the image to a 200x200 picture. The image then takes the grayscale values and converts them to a corresponding ASCII character based on 10 levels of grayscale. This code sucks and takes too long. Attached is an side-by-side comparison of the source image and the output of the script. 
The image I ended up taking was rather dark so the output is pretty bad but I think with either adding more levels or taking images with more contrast, the output will be better. I think it's good enough to show the point of the script though.
